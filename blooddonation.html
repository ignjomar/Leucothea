					<h1 id="title">Blood Donation</h1></center>
					<h1 id="hh">About</h1>
					<p id="content">The Leucothea Blood Bank is one of the major suppliers of blood in the country.  The LBB is tasked to provide safe and quality blood through its active role in advocacy, education and promotion of voluntary blood donation, donor recruitment, retention and care, blood collection, testing, processing and blood issuance through its network of 82 blood service facilities nationwide.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">What is Blood Donation?</h1>
					<p id="content">A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole-blood components). Donation may be of whole blood (WB), or of specific components directly (the latter called apheresis). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it. Today in the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In poorer countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation). Many donors donate as an act of charity, but in countries that allow paid donation some donors are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. Donors can also have blood drawn for their own future use (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint. Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis. The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place. For example, in the United States, donors must wait eight weeks (56 days) between whole blood donations but only seven days between plateletpheresis donations and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis. The amount of blood drawn and the methods vary. The collection can be done manually or with automated equipment that takes only specific components of the blood. Most of the components of blood used for transfusions have a short shelf life, and maintaining a constant supply is a persistent problem. This has led to some increased interest in autotransfusion, whereby a patient's blood is salvaged during surgery for continuous reinfusion—or alternatively, is "self-donated" prior to when it will be needed. (Generally, the notion of "donation" does not refer to giving to one's self, though in this context it has become somewhat acceptably idiomatic.)</p>
					<h1 id="hh">Preparation before donating blood</h1>
					<p id="content">1. Have enough rest and sleep.<br>2. No alcohol intake 24 hours prior to blood donation.<br>3. No medications for at least 24 hours prior to blood donation.<br>4. Have something to eat prior to blood donation, avoid fatty food.<br>5. Drink plenty of fluid, like water or juice.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">Steps in donating blood</h1>
					<p id="content">1. Have your weight taken.<br>2. Register and honestly and complete the donor registration form.<br>3. Have your blood type and hemoglobin checked.<br>4. A physician will conduct a blood donor examination.<br>5. Actual donation--the amount of blood to be donated (either 350cc or 450cc) will depend on the donor's weight and blood pressure. It usually takes 10 minutes or less.<br>6. A 5 to 10 minute rest and plenty of fluid-intake are necessary after donation.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">What to do after blood donation?</h1>
					<p id="content">1. Drink plenty of fluid, like water or juice.<br>2. Refrain from stooping down after blood donation.<br>3. Refrain from strenuous activities like:<br>a. Lifting heavy objects;<br>b. Driving big vehicles such as bus, trucks, etc.; or<br>c. Operating big machines.<br>4. Avoid using the punctured arm in lifting heavy objects.<br>5. Apply pressure on the punctured site and lift the arm in case the site is still bleeding.<br>6. If there is discoloration and swelling on the punctured site, you may apply cold compress for 24 hours.<br>7. If there is dizziness, just lie down with your feet elevated. Drink plenty of juice; and in just a few minutes or so, it will pass.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">Blood Donation: Basic Requirements</h1>
					<p id="content">Blood donation helps save lives. Find out if you're eligible to donate blood and what to expect if you decide to donate.<br>The need for blood is great. On any given day, more than two thousand of blood units are transfused to patients in our country. Some may need blood during surgery; while others depend on it after an accident or because they have a disease that requires blood components. The Philippine Red Cross approximately supplies one-fourth of the country's national blood requirements.If you're in good health, you can probably donate. Find out about blood donation and what to expect if you decide to give.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">Who can donate blood?</h1>
					<p id="content">You can donate blood if you…<br>- Are in good health<br>- Are between 16 to 65 years old (16 and 17 years old need parents consent);<br>- Weigh at least 110 pounds;<br>- Have a blood pressure between: Systolic: 90-160 mmHg, Diastolic: 60-100 mmHg; and<br>- Pass the physical and health history assessments.
					<br><br>Leucothea Blood Services Facilities carefully screen potential donors. The screening guidelines are necessary to ensure that blood donation is safe for you and that it is safe for the person who will be receiving your blood.<br><br>In the screening process, you have to fill out a blood donation questionnaire form that includes direct questions about behaviors known to carry a higher risk of blood-borne infections—infections that are transmitted through the blood. These behaviors include prostitution, intravenous drug use and others. A trained physician will be asking you about your medical/ health history, and a physical examination will be conducted—which includes checking your blood pressure, pulse and temperature. All of the information from this evaluation is kept strictly confidential.
					<br><br>During your blood donation screening procedure, a small sample of blood taken from a finger prick is used to check your hemoglobin level, the oxygen-carrying component of your blood. If your hemoglobin concentration is normal, and you've met all the other screening requirements, you can donate blood.</p>
