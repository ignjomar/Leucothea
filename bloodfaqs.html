					<h1 id="title">Blood Donation FAQs</h1>
					<h1 id="hh">Is it safe to give blood?</h1>
					<p id="content"> Yes. Donating blood is safe. The supplies used to collect your blood are sterile and only used once. You cannot get HIV or any other infectious disease from donating blood.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">I'm taking medications. Can I still donate blood?</h1>
					<p id="content">Many medications are acceptable. Consult your physician to be sure you're well enough to donate and ask your community blood center medical staff if you have questions about your eligibility to donate. Do not assume you're not eligible without inquiring.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">Will recent vaccinations make me ineligible to donate blood?</h1>
					<p id="content">Recent vaccinations may prevent you from donating blood. For example, you may be temporarily deferred if you have recently received a vaccine made from live viruses or if you have received vaccines to prevent infection after exposure to an infection. Flu vaccines are NOT cause for deferral. If you are unsure, contact your blood center and ask!</p>
					<h1 id="hh">How long does it take to give blood?</h1>
					<p id="content">The process for whole blood donation usually takes about one hour with the collection itself usually lasting only about 10 minutes. Expect to spend about two hours for an apheresis platelet collection. The donation process includes registration, a brief medical screening, blood collection, and refreshments.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">How much blood do I have?</h1>
					<p id="content">Women have about 10 pints, and men about 12 pints of blood in their bodies.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">How much blood is taken?</h1>
					<p id="content">Whole blood and apheresis (platelet) donations are about 1 pint. One pint is roughly equal to 1 pound.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">What are?</h1>
					<ul id="content">
						<li>Red Cells - these give your blood its red color and carry oxygen to your organs and tissues.</li>
						<li>Platelets - the very small colorless cell fragments in your blood whose main function is to stop bleeding.</li>
						<li>Plasma - this is the liquid portion of your blood that transports water and nutrients to your body's tissues.</li>
					</ul>
					<h1 id="hh">How often can I give?</h1>
					<p id ="content">Donate whole blood every 56 days. Red blood cells are the oxygen carrying cells. They can take two weeks or longer to fully return to normal. Donate platelets (apheresis donation) as much as twice in a 7 day period - or up to 24 times in a rolling 12 months. Platelet and plasma components are replaced in the body more quickly than red cells. Platelets will return to normal levels within a few hours of donating. Plasma, the watery substance of your blood, takes a couple of days.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">Are there age limits for blood donors?</h1>
					<p id ="content">Seventeen years old is the minimum blood donor age. (In some states, 16 years old may donate.) Some blood centers may have an upper age limit. Please call and check with your local blood center for more information.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">Is it safe to receive blood?</h1>
					<p id ="content">The blood supply is safe. Thirteen tests (10 for infectious diseases) are performed on each unit of donated blood. Blood donor eligibility standards, individual donor screening, laboratory testing, confidential exclusion of donations, and donor record checks are in place at donor centers to help ensure the safety of blood transfusions.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">What is Universal Blood Type?</h1>
					<p id ="content">Type O negative is the universal donor and can give blood to any other blood type. Eight percent of the U.S. population has O negative blood. AB positive is the universal recipient and can receive blood from any other blood type. Two and a half percent of the U.S. population has AB positive blood.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">What is double red cell donation?</h1>
					<p id ="content">Double red cell donations are performed using an apheresis machine, where the actual donation takes about 30-35 minutes, and allow you to donate two pints of red cells.</p>
					<h1 id="hh">How long until my blood is used?</h1>
					<p id="content">All blood donations are processed and available for use between 24 and 48 hours after collection</p>
					<ul id ="content">
						<li>Whole blood is processed into components (red cells, platelets, plasma). After processing, the red cells can be stored for up to 42 days.</li>
						<li>Plasma can be frozen and stored for up to 12 months.</li>
						<li>Platelets (from whole blood or by apheresis) must be used within five days.</li>
					</ul>
					<h1 id="hh">Are healthy history questions necessary every time?</h1>
					<p id ="content">Yes. Screening questions must be asked of all donors at each donation. This is an FDA requirement.</p>
