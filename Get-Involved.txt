<u><h2>Planning a Blood Drive</h2></u>
<h3> Step 1: Find Your Blood Center </h3>
<p>Find the nearest blood center in your neighborhood and ask about on how to donate blood and help others in finding bloods.</p>
<h3> Step 2: Contact Blood Center In Advance </h3> 
<p>Call your local blood center at least 3 months in advance of your desired blood drive date; blood centers and blood drive coordinators will need ample planning time. Please leave room for flexibility in dates for the drive, as the blood center may have other promotions and drives scheduled during your requested time-frame. The more flexible your schedule, the more easily you and your local blood center can work together to plan a successful event! 
<br>When contacting the blood center, ask to speak with the Donor Recruitment director or manager, they will be best equipped to help you with your request. </p>
<h3> Step 3: Discuss Ideas </h3>
<p>Provide the blood center with a detailed overview of your program and any specific ideas you would like to see implemented with your blood drive. </p>
<h3> Step 4: Recruit Blood Donors </h3>
<p> Work with your local blood center and donor recruitment staff to recruit blood donors within your community. Remember, not everyone is able to donate blood for various reasons, so you will need to recruit additional individuals to meet your goals.</p>
